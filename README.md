# graphics-projects
This is the repo for my CS450 graphics projects!  
Most of the files in this folder, such as the glut/glew libraries, are the project files needed to run OpenGL projects in Visual Studio. Much of these were supplied by professor Mike Bailey

- The folder "ActualProjectFiles" contains all the .cpp files that contain the main openGL code for the project. Those .cpp files can be moved into the root folder and run through the visual studio project (you may need to rename the .cpp file so the project recognizes it).  
- The folder "finalProj" contains another set of the files required to run an OpenGL project as I made use of shaders in the final projct. The main cpp file for the final project is finalProj.cpp.
